## Utilities

* **Data science Tasks**, including creation of datasets by web scraping(Pandas)
* **SQL Topics** on [SuperDataScience](https://www.superdatascience.com/pages/sql) with multiple challenges to gain insight on data.
Additionally, loading data into a database. Database design principles to handle a large amount of data.
* **MP4 to AVI** :
Use this to convert an mp4 file to AVI.
Usage : python script convert.py [path to mp4 file/ directory]
convert.exe in distributions folder - On systems without python ---> convert.exe [path]
* [Geospatial Analysis](https://github.com/abhijeetknayak/Utilities/tree/master/Data-Science/Country-Data) : Interesting way to visualize spatial information
  * Geopandas(Marker, Circle), Folium(Choropleth plots, heatmaps), etc.
  * Full course available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/geospatial-analysis)

## Country Data analysis
* All the data for this project was downloaded from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta) 
* Analysis tasks completed on the **[Child mortality rates](https://github.com/abhijeetknayak/Utilities/blob/master/Data-Science/Country-Data/child_mortality_analysis.ipynb)**:
  * Highest and lowest child mortality rates in the years 1990 and 2016
  * Plot the child moratlity rates on a map of the world using Choropleths
  * Plot the change in child mortality rates in the world on a map using a time slider choropleth
* Analysis tasks completed on [heathcare expenditure](https://github.com/abhijeetknayak/Utilities/blob/master/Data-Science/Country-Data/health-expenditure.ipynb):
  * Plot countries which have a health expenditure less than 5% of their GDP
  * Plot top 40 countries which have highest health expenditure
  * Make these plots interactive, so that you can check the values for each country individually
  * Compare values of Child mortality and health expenditure percentage. Try to correlate these values
