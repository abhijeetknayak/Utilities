## Country Data analysis
* All the data for this project was downloaded from [here](https://ourworldindata.org/health-meta) 
* Analysis tasks completed on the **[Child mortality rates](https://github.com/abhijeetknayak/Utilities/blob/master/Data-Science/Country-Data/child_mortality_analysis.ipynb)**:
  * Highest and lowest child mortality rates in the years 1990 and 2016
  * Plot the child moratlity rates on a map of the world using Choropleths
  * Plot the change in child mortality rates in the world on a map using a time slider choropleth
* Analysis tasks completed on [heathcare expenditure](https://github.com/abhijeetknayak/Utilities/blob/master/Data-Science/Country-Data/health-expenditure.ipynb):
  * Plot countries which have a health expenditure less than 5% of their GDP
  * Plot top 40 countries which have highest health expenditure
  * Make these plots interactive, so that you can check the values for each country individually
  * Compare values of Child mortality and health expenditure percentage. Try to correlate these values

  As shown, most of these countries have the same correlation between child mortality and health expenditure. There are a few exceptions though, for example:
    *  AFG: High Child mortality in-spite of having a higher health expenditure compared to other countries. Maybe because of the war
    * BRN: Brunei has same child mortality as Bulgaria (BGR), but the expenditure is much lesser. Maybe populations are not comparable
